"""Behavior v0.1.1: candidate labels for how the Solver responds to Critic feedback.

Each episode has a first answer (A1), the Critic's feedback, and a second
answer (A2). This module gives every episode two separate labels:

    feedback_type    what the Critic gave
    solver_response  what the Solver did in A2

The rules compare normalized text. They do not understand meaning, so the
labels are candidates until people have checked them. They are stored next to
the original lexical_v2 labels and never replace them.
