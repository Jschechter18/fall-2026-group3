    feature, and a matched random-feature control.

    Args:
        candidate_features: Latent feature indices to causally test (e.g. the
            top-SHAP features from probe_pipeline.py). Each gets suppressed
            (set to 0) and amplified (scaled up) independently, and both are
            compared against a reconstruction-only baseline and a
            matched-random-feature control.
        sparse_features: SAE latent vectors for the full sample, shape
            (n_samples, latent_dim). The same array probe_pipeline.py trained
            its probe on.
        labels: Binary solver_accepted_feedback labels, shape (n_samples,),
            aligned row-for-row with sparse_features.
        sae: A SparseAutoencoder instance (currently untrained, since no real
            activation data has been wired in yet -- see issue #39). Its
            .encoder()/.decoder() are used to re-encode and decode activations
            during each intervention.
        n_random_controls: How many features, drawn from outside
            candidate_features, to use as the matched random-feature control.
        amplify_scale: Multiplicative factor applied to a feature's value
            under the "amplify" intervention (z * amplify_scale + amplify_shift).
        amplify_shift: Additive shift applied under the "amplify" intervention.
        seed: Random seed, used both for the train/val split inside this
            function's probe refit and for choosing the random control dims.
