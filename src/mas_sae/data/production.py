"""Partition manifest and safe loading for the production activation data.

Every question belongs to exactly one partition, decided from its id and its
MuSiQue source split alone:

    train         fitting: the SAE, the probes, the per-layer probes
    validation    tuning: early stopping, layer choice, feature choice
    test          the frozen SAE and probes, scored once
    intervention  the causal experiment, run live, much later

All MuSiQue-validation questions are ``validation``. MuSiQue-train questions
are sorted by id, grouped by hop count and cut with a seeded shuffle into
``train`` / ``test`` / ``intervention``, so the assignment depends only on
the question set, the proportions and the seed, never on the order a run
collected them in. The proportions and seed are configuration, passed in by
the script that builds the package and recorded next to the manifest.

The split a run assigned while collecting (``experiment_split``) and the
layer scan's own split are kept as history and never read for decisions.
Questions that were part of earlier development data (the layer scan or the
first 100-row QC sample) are flagged. The flag records that a question was
available then, not that it was used in any decision. Held-out results can
be reported with and without these questions.

The cut is only reproducible from the exact same question set: remove one
question and the seeded shuffle moves many others. So the assignment is made
once and then frozen in ``partitions.csv`` (``PARTITION_FIELDS``), which is
committed to the repository. Every later run, including a re-collection,
takes its partitions from that file (``build_partition_manifest(frozen=...)``)
and only rebuilds the activation indices; it never derives membership again.

    The output has the layout the collection pipeline already produces, with the

            the original row is kept as source_run / source_activation_index)
        <export_result_root>/<export_run_name>/intervention_question_ids.json

    Only the named ``partitions`` are written. The default is the development
    pair, so a training directory never contains ``test.pt`` and nothing can
    score test by accident; ``test`` is exported at the freeze and
    ``intervention`` at the causal stage, each under its own run name. The
    intervention id file is always written. Both destination directories must
    not exist yet, so an export can never overwrite or leave stale files.
